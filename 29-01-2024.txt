there are are 4 types of clouds:
1. public - The user can do any thing in the website
2. private - the user has the credentials to use the data eg: IAM User like 
3. hybrid - The combination of public and private cloud
4. community - for the group of companies or organisations we use Eg: Enterprise- Many organisations will eb there and businness - Single company weill be theere



Difference between the onpremise and cloud :
On premise - 
Cloud - 
The user wants to move from the onpremise to the cloud it is called as Migration..


Disadvantages of Maintaining all data in Physical not cloud :
1. Cost high
2. Difficult to maintain server
3. Data is hack or lost we dont have the backup as effective as cloud

Advantages of Maintaining all data in cloud:
so with the help of cloud the user has the access of going smoothly


If the data is present in some other region then we have the ability to get the data from other region..
In India there are two data centers :
1. Mumbai
2. Hyderabad
but these two are not root users they are avilabe for IAM.

-----The region consisting of data centers and the location nearest data centers is called as Edge Location
-----If we want to migrate data from one region to other is called cross region replication 
     Eg:  for every person what we are storing in s3 so we are said to be it is storing in 6 regions so if one region dont get the data other region gets..


IAAS :
There is no need to maintain the data service physically so just we need to store or migrate the data onpremise into cloud.
PAAS :
it takes care of program execution and all our testing sites. the platform must be independent Eg: Integration service
SAAS:
all services or softwares like EC2 are applicable etc .. it belongs to SAAS.

AMI - Amazon Machine Images (all the services in AWS are done in Linux pinus through microservices) for that we take the T2 microservices 
Storge service : Eg: S3- SImple storage service 
                     S3galcier -- faster retrieval of data
                     S3 departer-- if we store the data it will remain many of time

There are 6 pillars of architecture :
.1. Operational Exellence - Moving the data from the onpremise to the cloud 
 2. realibility - Message is sent and recieved correctly and within the time interval
 3. security
 ** scalability - Depending on user configurations scaling on done horizontally - scaling is done on the data we have or vertically- it is done on the configurations
 4. Performance Efficiency
 5. Cost optimization
 6. Sustaninability

-----------

Instances:
--------
Ec2(Elastic computing cloud)
---------------------------
-->acts as the virtual server which can be taken for rent for creating the instances
-->we need to select AMI in that(Amazon machine images) which contain 20 operatimg systems
   ...we select default linux
      keypair-as our wish(but default we do not select)

Types of Instances:
-------------------
1.Reserved instances--6 months
2.sizing instances--talks about automatic scaling
3.Spot Instances--which we can rent on immediately


Migration Services:
----------------------
Amazon RDS:
-----------
-->2 types of  database
1.relational databases
    ex:excel workbook
2. non relational databases
     pattern is there but no relation between them
     Ex:amazon DynamoDB-no sql database

Amazon Aurora replicas:
-----------------------
which talks about IAM,caching
    IAM-for giving access
    caching--temporary storage is done for ceratian aamount of time

Aamazon schema conversion tool:
--------------------------------
By using OLTP schema(Online Transactions Processing),we convert data from one database to another databse

Authristation and containerisation:
---------------------------------
ECS-Elastic container service
EKS-elastic kubernetis service

ECR(Elastic container Registering)
--------------------------------
-->mainly for documenting processing
-->acts as the user guide or the user manual

EBS(Elastic block store)
------------------------
-->mainly for running the code in cloud without thinking for any other resources 
-->everything will be done by aws(delete,retrieve,etc..)


ELB(Elastic load balancing):
----------------------------
-->automatically balances the data which are uploaded by the user
-->we need to monitor the health of the data which doing this
--> It uatomatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets
-->In the status check,you can find the data is correctly accesed,executed,and no hacking done on the data(privacy)
    ACL---Acess control list--where the user can decide for whom we need to give access or not


VPC(virtual private cloud):
-------------------------
--> connecting private network interfaces together
-->default IP address we use-->129.168.0.0./16

Subnets:
--------
--> after creating vps we need to create subnets

INternet gateway:
------------------
-->used for routing all ur traffic by using inbound rules and outbound rules
     Inbound--it is for incoming traffic
     Outbound--outgoing traffic
--> we need to attach this Internet gateway to the vpc created

Route Table:
-------------
--> it consists of subnet associations and all the data which need to route from one vpc to another vpc

Transit Gateway:
-----------------
-->connecting one service to another service
-->acts as the medium for the 2 services connected

Lambda:
-------
--> It is a Serverless computing service
    Managed services--which are given by aws by deafult 
    customised services---where user can make changes as user requirement
--> Not worrying about server management

Lightsail:
----------
--> used for managing the VPNs(Virtual Private Network)
--> VPNs like TurboC etc.. for security

Outpost:
--------
--> service where we use for own dara centre computing(EC2) and storing the data(s3)

Batch:
-------
--> It is used for scheduling and runnings the jobs(Queuing)

Local Zones(Edge Locations):
----------------------------
--> defined as the nearest locations to the user
Advantages:
----------
-->to reduce the latency(waiting time)
-->increase the bandwidth

Global Zones:
-------------
-->onpremise to the cloud
--> multisharing cloud


Wavelength:
-----------
--> data running in the data centres of 5G network
--> low latency

AWS APP RUNNER:
---------------
--> used for running your containerised service(ECS,EKS,ECR)
   containerised --module--small appliaction which we take from large application to run it

AWS Fargate:
------------
--> deploy and manage the containerized applications without the need to manage the infrastructure


ADVANTAGES OF AWS:
-----------------
1. No data loss---AWS is ntg but the cloud,data will not be lost
2. Automatic Scaling--depending uopn the workload no person will be to scaled the data
3. Serverless Architectures
4. GO globally in miutes
5. Pay as go service model--pay for the services which u use only
6. Agility--running your run time time executions in short span of time
7. High Availability---services are available to the user in all the regions for 24/7
8. Security
